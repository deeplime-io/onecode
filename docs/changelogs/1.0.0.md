## :warning: Breaking changes

While it has been nice to get started with, Streamlit app generation is no longer part of OneCode. See [`onecode-streamlit`](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode-streamlit) for more information on backward-compatibility.

Checkout [this guide to upgrade from `0.x`](https://deeplime-io.github.io/onecode/1.0.0/#upgrading-from-0x).


## :ledger: Notes

* `pyarrow` no longer a direct dependency of `onecode`. As a consequence, `CsvReader` element no longer read CSV through `pyarrow.read_csv()` but `pandas.read_csv()`
* `pydantic` no longer a strong dependency, it was moved to the `developer` dependencies. Therefore using the variable `ONECODE_DO_TYPECHECK=1` requires the `pydantic` installation.
