## :warning: Breaking changes

* Streamlit no longer part of OneCode. See `onecode-streamlit` for more information.

## :ledger: Notes

* `pyarrow` no longer a direct dependency of `onecode`. As a consequence, `CsvReader` element no longer read CSV through `pyarrow.read_csv()` but `pandas.read_csv()`
* `pydantic` no longer a strong dependency, it was moved to the `developer` dependencies. Therefore using the variable `ONECODE_DO_TYPECHECK=1` requires the `pydantic` installation.
