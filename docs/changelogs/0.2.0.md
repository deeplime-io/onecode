[9](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/9) | Correct `gatherUsageStats` env variable | `onecode-start` used wrong variable name to prevent sending stats.

## Enhancements

:octicons-issue-opened-24: Issue Ref | :fontawesome-solid-thumbtack: Summary | :material-message-text: Description
-|-|-
[5](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/5) | Improving DeepLearning example | Allow initialization of NeuralNetInput custom element with different layer specs.
[10](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/10) | Allow for custom import and init statements in InputElement and OutputElement | Streamlit `app.py` generated through `onecode-start` now has placeholders for import and init statements. See `imports()` and `init()` static methods in `InputElement` and `OutputElement`.


## New Features

-|-|-
[1](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/1) | New input element FolderInput | FolderInput allows folder selection. LASConverter example showcases it.
[2](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/2) | New output element PlotlyOutput | PlotlyOutput allows to visualize Plotly charts. ExperimentalVariography example showcases it.


## :warning: Breaking changes
[10](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/10) introduces a potential breaking change if you have custom `InputElement` or `OutputElement` where the `streamlit()` method relies on one of these statements being present in `app.py`:
* `import tkinter as tk`
* `from tkinter import filedialog`
* `import numpy as np`
* `from pyarrow import csv as pacsv`
* `_root = tk.Tk()`

If this is the case, simply inherit `import()` and/or `init()` static methods so that they return the relevant statements.
See `FileInput.imports()` and `FileInput.init()` as examples.
