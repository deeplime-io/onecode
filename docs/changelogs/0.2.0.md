[9](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/9) | Correct `gatherUsageStats` env variable | `onecode-start` used wrong variable name to prevent sending stats.
[No ref] | `kind` is now a property of the `InputElement` and `OutputElement` | `kind` would have potentially been overwritten while extracting element through `onecode-extract`.

[5](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/5) | Improving DeepLearning example | Allow initialization of `NeuralNetInput` custom element with different layer specs.
[No ref] | Allow meta-data for elements | Meta-data can now be attached to any Input/Output element through `**kwargs`.


## New Features

-|-|-
[1](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/1) | New input element `FolderInput` | `FolderInput` allows folder selection. `LASConverter` example showcases it.
[2](https://github.com/deeplime-io/onecode/issues/2) | New output element `PlotlyOutput` | `PlotlyOutput` allows to visualize Plotly charts. `ExperimentalVariography` example showcases it.

## :warning: Breaking changes
* Custom `InputElement` or `OutputElement` can no longer initialized with an argument named `kind`:
it now is a reserved attribute. This change was triggered by a bug fix as `kind` was potentially overwritten
when extracting element through `onecode-extract`. Upgrade your custom element by changing your argument name.
